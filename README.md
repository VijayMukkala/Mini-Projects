## Predicting if an Incident is Hack or not

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VijayMukkala/Mini-Projects/master/Predict_incident-is-hack/hacker-1944688_640.jpg)

The problem is to build a predictive model which can identify a pattern in the data and suggest that a hack is going to happen, So that the cyber security can somehow stop it before it happens.

In this exercise , we will explore how to cluster different groups of customers and infer from their behaviour.

- Data was obtained at a University Hospital in Portugal and contais several demographic, risk factors, laboratory and overall survival features of 165 real patients diagnosed with Hepatocellular carcinoma.
- We will also develop a classifier to predict the survival of patient having HCC

## Risk Classification on Insurance data

- In Insurance Industry , even with the integration of more modern financial economics into the insurance process, much of it relies on 'assumption based' approaches - such as determining the Discount Rate to be used - this is where __Machine Learning__ comes in.
- The data set here attempts to distinguish applicants into the categoried of levels 1-8.
