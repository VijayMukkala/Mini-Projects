In this exercise , we will explore how to cluster different groups of customers and infer from their behaviour.

- Data was obtained at a University Hospital in Portugal and contais several demographic, risk factors, laboratory and overall survival features of 165 real patients diagnosed with Hepatocellular carcinoma.
- In this exercise, we will explore the basic use of Pandas and will cover the basic commands of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) which includes cleaning, munging, combining, reshaping, slicing, dicing, and transforming data for analysis purpose. We will also develop a classifier to predict the survival of patient having HCC

- In Insurance Industry , even with the integration of more modern financial economics into the insurance process, much of it relies on 'assumption based' approaches - such as determining the Discount Rate to be used - this is where __Machine Learning__ comes in.
- The data set here attempts to distinguish applicants into the categoried of levels 1-8.
